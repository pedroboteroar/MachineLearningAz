    "Splitting data into a training set and a test set is a common operation in machine learning. The training set is used to train the model and the test set is used to evaluate the model. The test set is used to evaluate the model because it is data that the model has not seen before. If the model performs well on the test set, we can be confident that it will perform well on unseen data.\n",
